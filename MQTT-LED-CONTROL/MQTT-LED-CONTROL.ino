/*
 * MQTT Code for CDAC Students to Subscribe to Topics for LED Control
 * MQTT Subscriber for Event-Based Communication
 * Uses PubSubClient and ArduinoJson library for MQTT functionality
 * Install Libraries: PubSubClient by Nick O'Leary and ArduinoJson by Beno√Æt Blanchon
 *
 * Documentation Reference:
 * 1. PubSubClient: https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/
 * 2. ArduinoJson: https://arduinojson.org/v6/doc/
 * 3. WiFi Library: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFi
 * 4. ESP-IDF WiFi MAC API: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_wifi.html
 *
 * Use Case:
 * This application demonstrates MQTT communication to control an LED based on "ON" and "OFF" commands.

 * Callback Function: handleIncomingCommand
 * Description: Processes messages received from the subscribed MQTT topic.

 * - topic: The MQTT topic from which the message was received.
 * - payload: The message payload as a byte array.
 * - length: Length of the payload array.
 * Behavior:
 * - If the message is "ON", the built-in LED is turned on.
 * - If the message is "OFF", the built-in LED is turned off.
 * - Logs unknown commands for debugging purposes.

 * - Logs connection and subscription status.
 * Returns:
 * - true: If successfully connected and subscribed.
